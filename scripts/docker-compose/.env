# The .env file is used by docker-compose to prevent hard-coding and reusable variables
# This can be modified and placed in the same directory as the docker-compose file when running
# Actual environment variables set in the shell will override these, if it is preferred to define that way at runtime
# eg. 1. export MYSQL_DATABASE=upperneno ; 2. docker-compose up
# The effects of these can be tested by running "docker-compose config"
